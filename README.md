This is a [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb) project bootstrapped with the `app/empty` template.

This template is useful if you already know what you're doing and just want a clean slate. By default, it
just creates a blank home page (which prints to the console so you can confirm it's working)

If you are still learning, consider instantiating the `app` template (or one of the examples) to see actual,
working projects.

### MY NOTES

* jsMain indicates Front-End, jvmMain indicates Back-end.
* :common module is used to make reusable components/classes for both jsMain/jvmMain in :site module
* Every file named "Index" in jsMain, represents as a main page of the directory (root of website)


## IMO:
Kobweb still unstable and not recommended to have a production with.
I just simply use KobWeb only for preview and experimenting
